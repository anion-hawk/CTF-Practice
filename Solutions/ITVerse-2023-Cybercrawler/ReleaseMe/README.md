## Problem

I wanted to send a file to my friend. Therefore, I sent this picture to my friend, Jony. However, he was surprised by its length. I hinted to him, 'Jony, please free me from this lengthy trap. They don't want me to walk towards the bin directory. If you want to find me, look for me underneath the string.'

Now, I'm wondering if he was able to decipher that sequence. But you know what? Only by finding the attacker's signature can his final goal be achieved. That's when I'll be released from this trap. Could you please help him?

## Solution

Use the `strings` command on the file and query the flag prefix among the resulting strings
