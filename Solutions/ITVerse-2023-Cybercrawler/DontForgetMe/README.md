## Problem

My boss's name is Bind. He wants everyone to believe that he has no knowledge about hacking. Thus, if someone were to steal his image, they might assume he doesn't know how to hide messages.

However, I am aware that the boss doesn't do anything straightforward. So, when I found it easy to hide, I thought this wasn't the end. Following that, the boss privately called me and said, 'Don't forget me. I am still alive,' ending the conversation there.

This has left me in a state of confusion. What could the hint 'Don't forget me' mean? Can you decode the hint?
