## Problem

I have a super-secret message for my friend, who isn't very tech-savvy and lacks expertise in IT. As the message is highly confidential, I need to conceal it within eight categorized images, each numbered, to guide him through the process. However, despite this assistance, he still struggles to understand the process. Could you please help him uncover the super-secret message?

Note:I use numbers such as 1, 2, 3, etc., to facilitate understanding which image comes next

## Solution

Use the `steghide` command on the  `HereIam.jpg` file and use the letters from the other file names concatenated as the password.
